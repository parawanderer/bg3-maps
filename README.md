Baldurs Gate 3 Map Projects
=======

In September of 2024 I dabbled with the [Baldurs Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) (which I can definitely recommend, it was great fun!) Mod Creation scene and made the first-ever community-created "maps" (environments) for this game.


## Sea Castle
This is the first map I made in their modding toolkit, which was [the **first** ever community-created map](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1ffuhay/custom_map_created_using_unlocked_toolkit/).

## Avernus

Subsequently I also made another themed environment that the community of this game quite appreciated: [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1fi2l08/avernus_caelidinspired_map_using_the_unlocked/), [progress update](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1fnn5s8/avernus_caelid_custom_map_mod_progress/).

## Publicity
### Apparently, this was interesting enough that a bunch of video game journalists wrote articles about it üò≤:

I did not end up going much further with this project due to personal priorities/job reasons and lack of time.

I'm sharing this publicly now for visibility.

As of now it is more or less certain that I will not pick this up any further, and so that anybody who might really feel like it could potentially pick up the work on this.
